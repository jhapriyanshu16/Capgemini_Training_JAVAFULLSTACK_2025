//1.A program checks a student’s marks. If the marks are greater than or equal to 40 and attendance is above 75%, the student passes; otherwise, the student fails.Use relational and logical operators to check eligibility, the conditional operator to decide pass or fail, and a compound assignment operator to add 5 bonus marks if the student passes.


public class Q1PassOrFail {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int marks = 17;
		int att = 75;
		String res = (marks>=40 && att > 75) ? "Pass" : "Fail";
		marks = (res == "Pass")? (marks+=5) : marks;
		System.out.println(res);
